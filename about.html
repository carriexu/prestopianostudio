                <h3>Junyi (Jimmy) Liu - Founder & Principal Instructor</h3>
                <p>Jimmy Liu is a dedicated classical pianist who combines his love for music with a passion for teaching. His musical journey began at age 6 when his family relocated from Changchun, China to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As Jimmy's skills developed, he achieved notable success in piano competitions, including prizes in the Duquesne Young Artist, PPTA, MTNA PA State, Pittsburgh Civic Orchestra, and Louis Streator/Smith Memorial Piano Competition.</p>
                <p>Jimmy furthered his musical education at Carnegie Mellon University, where he earned both his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in piano performance. During his time at CMU, he won prizes in the Concerto Competition and in the Silberman Chamber Music Competition.  He also obtained certificates in piano tuning and piano pedagogy, broadening his expertise in the field. Jimmy has tuned in over 750 homes in Pittsburgh and is the current piano technician for Chatham University and the Ellis School. Additionally, Jimmy co-founded Piano 4TE, an innovative ensemble that performs on four separate pianos. </p>
                <p>Today, Jimmy maintains a thriving piano studio with 45 students, ranging in age from 5 to 75. His students have achieved remarkable success, winning prizes in competitions such as the Pittsburgh International Piano Competition, Steinway Society Young Artist, and Duquesne Young Artist, and performing at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall in NYC and Heinz Hall in Pittsburgh.</p>
                <p>Jimmy's teaching approach combines technical skill development with fostering a deep appreciation for music. He tailors his instruction to each student's goals, whether they're preparing for ABRSM (Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music) examinations, local performances, or simply playing for personal enjoyment. By creating a supportive learning environment, Jimmy helps his students build confidence, overcome challenges, and discover the joy of musical expression through the piano.</p>
